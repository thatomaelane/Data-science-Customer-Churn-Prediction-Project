# Data-science-Customer-Churn-Prediction-Project

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a telecom customer is likely to churn based on their service usage and contract attributes.

## Project Goals
- Predict customer churn using real-world telecom data.
- Compare multiple machine learning models for performance.
- Gain insights into what influences customer retention.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Libraries: pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, XGBoost

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

## Results
- **Best Model**: Logistic Regression (Accuracy ~81%)
- **Important Features**: Contract Type, Monthly Charges, Tenure
- **Metrics**: Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## Skills Learned
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Handling missing values and converting data types
- Encoding categorical features
- Model evaluation using classification metrics
- Comparing classifiers to solve real-world business problems
